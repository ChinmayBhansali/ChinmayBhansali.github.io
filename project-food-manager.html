                We followed the <strong>User Interface Design Process</strong> framework,
                progressing through Pre-Design, Early Design, and Mid Design stages. Each stage
                built upon the previous, evolving from understanding users to creating testable prototypes.

            <p class="stage-intro">
                The Pre-Design stage focused on understanding our users: who they are and their key tasks.
                I led the user research effort, conducting the majority of interviews and performing
                qualitative data analysis to uncover design requirements.

            <div class="stage-section">
                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    Our primary goal was to understand the problem space of household food waste.
                    We aimed to answer three research questions:
                </p>
                <ul class="research-questions">
                    <li><strong>RQ1:</strong> How often do people buy excess groceries that are ultimately wasted?</li>
                    <li><strong>RQ2:</strong> What type of food is wasted most in households and why?</li>
                    <li><strong>RQ3:</strong> What approaches do people take to reduce their food waste?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="stage-section">
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    We conducted <strong>semi-structured interviews</strong> with 11 participants from varied
                    living situations (alone, with roommates, or with family). Participants ranged from ages
                    17–30, all recruited from CPSC 344. We recorded responses on datasheets and asked follow-up
                    questions to probe deeper into their food waste habits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After data collection, I performed <strong>thematic analysis</strong> using affinity
                    diagramming to identify patterns across participant responses. This involved grouping
                    related responses and synthesizing them into actionable themes.
                </p>

                    <h4>Finding 1: Most people waste food monthly or less</h4>
                    <p>
                        Out of 11 participants, 7 reported throwing out groceries once a month or less,
                        while 3 reported waste every 1–2 weeks, and 1 said they never wasted food.
                        This suggests food waste is a common but not daily occurrence for most.

                        8 out of 11 participants reported that items with short shelf-life (vegetables,
                        fruits, and prepared meals) were wasted most frequently. The primary reasons
                        included quick expiration, buying more than needed, and simply forgetting about the food.

        <section class="project-stage">
            <h2>Early Design</h2>
            <p class="stage-intro">
                The Early Design stage focused on understanding the design space and choosing our approach.
                We developed conceptual models, created low-fidelity prototypes, and conducted cognitive
                walkthroughs to validate our direction.
            </p>

            <div class="stage-section">
                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    Our goals were to explore the design space, identify risks, and choose a design approach
                    that would address the two central tasks: <strong>tracking food inventory</strong> and
                    <strong>finding use ideas</strong> before food expires.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="stage-section">
                <h3>Conceptual Model: "Conveyor" → "Factory"</h3>
                <p>
                    Our initial <strong>"Conveyor" conceptual model</strong> imagined a conveyor belt where
                    grocery items moved toward expiry. Items would be visible at all times, with their position
                    representing time until expiration.
                </p>
                <figure class="project-figure">
                    <img src="data/design_outcome_report_fig1.png"

                    <figcaption>Figure 1: Initial "Conveyor" conceptual model</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    However, cognitive walkthroughs revealed this model couldn't connect with recipe-finding
                    features. We evolved it into the <strong>"Factory" model</strong>, adding task-specific
                    "stations":
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Groceries tab</strong> = "Bulletin board" - requests items to purchase</li>
                    <li><strong>Pantry tab</strong> = "Loading zone" - tracks items and expiry dates</li>
                    <li><strong>Find Recipes</strong> = "Factory floor" - uses items before expiry</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="stage-section">
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    We used <strong>low-fidelity prototyping</strong> to quickly explore ideas and
                    <strong>cognitive walkthroughs</strong> to evaluate them internally. Initial designs
                    had five screens for distinct tasks, but internal evaluations found this too cluttered.
                    We simplified to two main tabs (Grocery List and Pantry) with integrated features.

                <p>
                    The Early Design stage produced throw-away prototypes, a refined design direction,
                    and the "Factory" conceptual model that would guide our medium-fidelity work.

                    We conducted <strong>usability testing</strong> with 11 participants (ages 19+). Each session
                    included think-aloud observation while completing tasks, followed by a questionnaire
                    with Likert-scale and open-ended questions. Sessions were recorded on UBC Zoom when
                    participants consented.

                <p>
                    I tracked objective metrics (click counts, task completion) using coding sheets and
                    performed <strong>thematic analysis</strong> on questionnaire responses to identify
                    patterns in user feedback.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                This project concluded after the Mid Design stage. While we didn't proceed to high-fidelity
                implementation, the work produced validated design requirements, a robust conceptual model,
                and actionable recommendations backed by user research.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Key learnings:</strong> In hindsight, we should have allowed users to explore the
                prototype before testing to avoid measuring learnability instead of efficiency. We also
                learned the importance of more low-fidelity iteration before progressing to medium-fidelity
                prototyping.
